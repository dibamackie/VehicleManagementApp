Vehicle Management Application
This is a JavaFX desktop application that collects and manages vehicle details, usage logs, and maintenance records. The application uses FXML for the user interface and a modular design with separate model classes for Vehicle, UsageLog, MaintenanceRecord, and SummaryRecord. A unified "Next" button saves data and navigates through multiple screens, culminating in a summary view that aggregates all entries.
