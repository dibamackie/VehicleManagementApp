# Vehicle Management Application

This JavaFX desktop application collects and manages vehicle details, usage logs, and maintenance records. It uses FXML for its user interface and a modular design with separate model classes (Vehicle, UsageLog, MaintenanceRecord, and SummaryRecord). A unified "Next" button saves data and navigates through multiple screens, culminating in a summary view that aggregates all entries.

## Features

  Enter vehicle details, usage logs, and maintenance records on separate screens.
- **Data Aggregation:**  
  All data is combined and displayed on a summary screen.
- **Modular Design:**
